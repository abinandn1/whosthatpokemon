# Who's That Pokemon?

## Description
A simple Who's That Pokemon Game that I made while learning React. Made with React, Bootstrap, HTML and CSS. Covers Pokemon up to Gen 7.

## Bugs:
- Inconsistent blurring and unblurring
- Constant score increase
- Fix inconsistent font on buttons
- Implement React-Bootstrap fully and remove Bootstrap elements

## Todo:
- Implement proper Pokemon Silhouettes
- Implement Leaderboard (Database)
- Implement hitting Enter to confirm answer
- Implement choosing generation of Pokemon to play 
- Implement different game modes/screens (ranked, casual, etc)
- Cleanup scrapped/unused dependencies/node modules
- Split up game into multiple components?
